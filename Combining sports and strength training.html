							<h1>Combining sports with weight training sessions</h1>
							<p>As a college student I have also come across this problem where I need to juggle playing sports with my friends like badminton and going to the gym. 
								I have experienced many different methods of juggling and will be able to provide tips to handle both. 
								I do not recommend people skipping their hobbies for the sake of building muscle because sports also play a very important role in our social life.
						<p>If you are playing sports regularly, gym cardio should be reduced or cut down because playing sports is basically cardio. 
							This should be sufficient to obtain maximal cardiovascular benefits. 
							Besides, reducing your gym workout volume is crucial if you are really active in sports (4 to 5 sport sessions a week). 
							I reduced my training volume and frequency to 3-4 workout sessions a week in order to balance between sports and weight training because my recovery was affected. 
							Since you can only <b>grow as much as you recover</b>, reducing the volume to aid recovery is definitely necessary. Although it may not be optimal,
							 you can still make good gains for working out 3 times a week if you are consistently progressing. 
							 Similar to cardio, sports and weight training should be done in different sessions preferably weight training before sports as 
							 I usually find my performance to be impacted if I play badminton before working out in the gym. 
							 However, if your main goal is prepping for a competition in sports, you should do it the other way around. Basically, the important event comes first.
						</p>
					<h4>Tips for incorporating both sports and gym</h4>
					<ul>
						<p>1. Perform sports and gym at 2 different sessions. The one you want to prioritize should be done first.</p>
						<p>2. Reduce your frequency and volume to 2-3 times a week (depending on your fitness level) if recovery is impacted.</p>
						<p>3. Calorie intake should be sufficient as energy expenditure will be high if you are combining both.</p>
						<p>4. A lower joint impact sport such as swimming is preferred if given a choice.</p>
