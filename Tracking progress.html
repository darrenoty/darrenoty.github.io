							<h1>Methods of tracking progress</h1>
							<p>There are many ways to track progress and I shall include some of the ones that are easily accessible that I recommend.
							</p>
							<h2>Bodyweight scale
							</h2>
						<p>One of the easiest methods of measuring your progress is your body weight. 
							A body weight scale is easily accessible and can be purchased anywhere. 
							It will be best to measure your body weight early in the morning after using the washroom, before taking any fluids or food. 
							This will be able to reduce fluctuations in weight, giving you a more accurate result. 
							However, the downsides are you will not be able to track where the weight comes from. Is the weight from water due to excess sodium intake? 
							Is it glycogen? Is it body fat or muscle? The body weight will not be able to tell all these differences. 
							You may think it is muscle but the weight may come from extra body fat. 
							Therefore, if you are in a gaining phase, ensure that your weight gain is slow and steady instead of having huge increments. 
							This will be able to ensure that your weight gained is mostly muscle. 
							The opposite can be true as well, losing weight should also be slow to ensure it will mostly be mostly fat and not muscle. 
							Crash dieting will lead to an increased risk of muscle loss during a cutting phase. 
							It is also very important to use other forms of tracking such as your performance in the gym for a more accurate assessment.
						</p>
						<p>Advantages: Easy to access, can tell if you are going on the right track especially if you are bulking or cutting
						</p>
						<p>Disadvantages: Uncertain of the source of weight, some individuals may fear the body weight scale?
						</p>
						<h2>Progress photos/mirror</h2>
						<p>Progress photos are often taken to compare before and after. 
							This is a good way to compare progress especially after a period of time. 
							Minor changes occur on a day-to-day basis and we may not be able to detect these small changes, if any. 
							Taking a photo and comparing will be able to solve those issues. 
							Moreover, you will also be able to guess your body fat percentages by looking at your pictures. 
							If you are getting leaner (more muscle definition, more vascularity or muscle striations), your body fat percentage is decreasing. 
							If you are getting pudgier, you may be putting on body fat instead of muscle. Lighting and your conditioning should be kept constant.
							 If you take pictures after your workout or early in the morning, 
							 make sure your comparison is taken under the same conditions for accurate assessment. 
							 This method may be more accurate than just relying on the scale alone. 
							 However, we tend to be over-critical of our own physique and may suffer from slight body dysmorphia. 
							 To solve this problem, we can send our pictures to a friend or someone experienced for them to assess. 
							 This will lead to a more accurate assessment. 
							 Please make sure you send to a friend who is experienced and not the type that loves to criticize your physique.
							 <p>Advantages: Easy access, can estimate body composition</p>
							 <p>Disadvantages: Overcritical on own physique, not suitable for those suffering from body dysmorphia
							</p>
							<h2>Progress in the gym</h2>
							<p>Progress in the gym is both the byproduct of muscle gained and the requirement to continue gaining muscle. 
								You will be stronger after gaining a few pounds of muscle. There are also several downsides to this method. 
								If you are on a hypocaloric diet, a decrease in strength is inevitable. This does not mean you are losing muscle, 
								it probably just means you do not have as much energy as you used to in a bulking phase. 
								An increase in strength may also be due to neuromuscular adaptations instead of muscle gain. 
								In addition, other factors such as sleep quality, stress levels may also impact your performance which is not an indicator of muscle loss.
							</p>
							<p>Advantages: Straightforward method to determine progress or muscle gained</p>
							<p>Disadvantages: Too many factors affecting performance such as calories, sleep and lifestyle stressors</p>
							<h2>Inbody scales</h2>
							<p>This form of measuring is not as easily accessible as not all gyms have this type of scale. 
								These scales measure by sending an electric current from 1 side of your body and receiving from the other. 
								The speed of conduction is measured. Muscle is mainly water which speeds up conduction and fat will slow down conduction. 
								This will lead to a measurement of muscle mass and body fat percentage. However, these scales also tend to give inaccurate readings. 
								The scales are not certain where the water comes from, is it from your stomach or your muscles? 
								I have noticed they tend to underestimate body fat percentages by at least 5 percent most of the time. 
								They are not the golden standard for body fat testing so please take their readings with a grain of salt. 
							</p>
							<p>Advantages: A guess for body fat percentage for inexperienced individuals
							</p>
							<p>Disadvantages: Not easily accessible, expensive to purchase, inaccuracy	</p>
							<h2>Skinfold calipers</h2>
							<p>Skinfold calipers measure the thickness of your skin to predict your body fat percentage. 
								This tool is very accurate and usually only varies only around 2 percent. 
								However, this tool requires expertise and good quality ones may cost a lot. 
								Not everyone including myself is familiar with the methods of using these calipers.
							</p>
							<p>Advantage: Fairly accurate assessment of body fat percentage
							</p>
							<p>Disadvantage: Requires expertise, may be expensive
							</p>
							<h2>Measurement tape</h2>
								<p>Using a measuring tape to measure the area of your body can be a good way to measure your progress. 
									Some areas of measurements include chest, hip measurement, waist or lower abdominals, biceps, shoulders and quads. 
									They can be done easily by anyone, anywhere. You just need to make sure your posture remains constant through all measurements. 
									Even though they may not be able to guess the increase is caused by muscle or fat, 
									an increase in lower abdominal circumference may not be a good sign as it is probably fat. 
									They can provide a rough guess on which body part is progressing and which plateaued. 
								</p>
								<p>Advantage: easily accessible, good guess of the progress of different body parts</p>
								<p>Disadvantage: Not able to differentiate fat or muscle, may require another person’s assistance to measure 
								</p>
								<h2>DEXA scan</h2>
								<p>DEXA stands for dual emission x-ray absorptiometry. 
									As the name suggests, this method of testing uses x-rays with different energy levels to measure. 
									They can measure a wide variety of statistics including bone density, body fat percentage and many more. 
									They are very costly but are considered fairly accurate and give a lot of readings that are beneficial to health. 
									They usually fluctuate around 4 percent in terms of accuracy while measuring body fat percentage. 
									I do not expect you to measure it on a weekly or monthly basis but it is preferred to only measure 
									if your progress has been approximately 5 percent to ensure accurate assessments.
								</p>
								<p>Advantage: Fairly accurate, gives stats other than body fat percentage and muscle mass</p>
								<p>Disadvantage: Expensive, small inaccuracies may lead to disappointment 	</p>
								<h5>As you can see, there are advantages and disadvantages to different methods of measuring your progress. 
									I recommend using different methods that complement each other’s weaknesses. 
									For example, I use a body weight scale every morning to ensure I am on the right track of gaining muscle. 
									In addition, I also use progress photos and measurements to make sure the weight gained is mostly due to muscle mass and not fat. 
									I also highly recommend different forms of measuring for best results.
								</h5>
								<h6>Good luck with your progress!
