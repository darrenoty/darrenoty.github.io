							<h1>Do we get too big by accident?</h1>
							<p>Can we get too muscular by accident? 
								We all know that weight lifting is beneficial for our health, 
								but what if we don’t want to get too big and muscular? What should we do then?
							</p>
						<p>First, I would like to address that it is almost impossible for all of us to get big by accident. 
							Some genetic outliers like the Mr Olympia may be able to build tons of muscle compared to the average population. 
							However, the personal want to build muscle is a crucial factor for muscle growth in and of itself. 
							Why is that so? If you do not want to build muscle, the odds are your training is not hard enough to stimulate muscle growth anyways. 
							It may be good enough for your health, but not sufficient to build muscle optimally, or build at all. 
						</p>
						<p>To build muscle you will need to challenge yourself consistently in the gym by something called ‘progressive overload’. 
							That simply does not occur by touching the dumbbells and expecting a “poof” where your muscle turns huge as if by magic.
						</p>
							<p>If you do not want to build muscle for a specific body part such as your arms or chest, 
								you can always train the body part less than the others. Do a bunch of warm-up sets or stay away from failure. 
								This will be able to reduce or prevent muscle growth for that specific body part. Just for the benefit of the doubt, 
								what if you really get too muscular. 
								You can always hold back the training and muscle atrophy (muscle loss) will occur as your body no longer sees a reason to keep the extra muscle in your body.
							</p>
							<p>In fact, strength training yields tons of benefits and should be incorporated into our exercise routine. 
								Benefits such as increasing metabolism, preventing osteoporosis and sarcopenia should be sufficient for you to incorporate them strategically and your body will thank you later in the future!
							</p>
								<p>P.s: If you are not looking to build muscle, strength training twice a week should be good enough for most people.
