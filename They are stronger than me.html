							<h1>They are stronger than me</h1>
							<p>Have you ever felt that no matter how hard you worked, 
								it would always be futile, and talent is what matters? 
								You may be consistently grinding in the gym or whichever aspects of your life, 
								only to see someone who put in less than half of your effort achieve better results than you. 
								I can totally relate to this, hence this article. Why bother working hard only to encounter disappointment later on?

							</p>
						<p>I understand there are many genetic outliers out there who seemed to have an unfair advantage over you. 
							I myself encountered many similar situations throughout my life with regards to both academic and fitness. 
							Some people I know may have gotten the concept so quickly that it made me feel like an idiot. 
							I have trained hard consistently and some may accuse me of looking like a couch potato. 
							I have even doubted myself if there is a point in this constant grinding, only to be critiqued in the end.

						</p>
						<p>However, my constant doubts and low self-esteem soon became an obstacle in my path. 
							There is a reason to keep grinding and pushing yourself to achieve what’s truly possible for you, 
							because you want to, that's it. You are responsible for trying your best, and deserve the satisfaction that comes along with it. 
							Therefore, why are we beating ourselves up over criticisms that took minimal effort to be given? 
							Do not be discouraged over what others think or say. We do not need to answer to others regarding our accomplishments, 
							only to ourselves. Others may only require 1 hour to learn something new, 
							if it takes 1 day for me, so be it, as I still got there eventually. 
							Look in the mirror and you will see both your competition and the only person you shall uphold your promises and results to. 

						</p>
							<p>Let’s assume your talent and genetics are just average. 
								You will still be able to be better than 80% of the population if you work hard. 
								Why is that so? Most people are not even willing to try their hardest, 
								they do everything half-heartedly, hoping to achieve results with that perception. 
								Despite having below-average genetics, you will also obtain the health benefits that come along with it while exercising. 
								Maybe some of us are destined to get a heart attack in their life, instead of getting it at the age of 40, 
								they may get it at the age of 65 or 70 if they put in the effort to exercise for their health. 
								We are only given 1 life, are those extra years of heath not worth fighting for?
							</p>
							<p>Hard work itself is not easy, 
								if you are able to put in the effort to do it, you already have an edge over most people. Don’t you think so?
