							<h1>Does your choice of split matter?</h1>
							<p>I came across this question myself ages ago. 
								Many of us believe that the push pull leg split is the best for muscle growth and we all should follow it if we want to obtain the best results. 
								I am not denying that push pull leg is a good way to train your body and many advanced bodybuilders utilize this split in their routine. 
								However, are upper lower and full body splits inferior compared to push pull leg? 
								Is the push pull leg actually the best split for you? I shall address this question in this post.
							</p>
						<p>Firstly, why do we need to categorize certain muscle groups to train in a specific way? 
							Why can’t we just train any muscle whenever we want? 
							The main reasons are to optimize recovery and ensure sufficient frequency of the muscle group per week. 
							If we train the same muscle group in 2 consecutive days, 
							we will not be able to recover sufficiently and hence underperform the 2nd day, 
							and thus leave gains on the table. 
							Compare that to training on separate days which allows for better recovery. 
							Research has also shown that training 2x per week is better than training only once a week. 
							If we do not group them strategically, we may undertrain certain muscle groups compared to others, 
							which may then lead to muscle imbalance.
						</p>
						<p>Now that’s out of the way, which is the best split for you? 
							That generally depends on how many days you can afford to train in a week. 
							If you can only train 2 to 3 days a week, full-body training is highly recommended as you will not run into recovery issues due to sufficient gaps in between training days. 
							A full-body training will also allow you to hit every muscle group at least twice a week. You may ask me what if you need to train 2 consecutive days but can the third day be separated? 
							In this case, I would recommend upper lower and full body to ensure you hit the body parts twice a week without hampering recovery.

						</p>
							<p>On the other hand, 
								if you can train 4 days a week, 
								an upper-lower split will be highly recommended. 
								This is also the split that I am currently using during college. 
								This split allows you to train each body part twice a week and leave plenty of recovery days in between. 
								You will have a minimum of 48 hours before training the same muscle group again.

							</p>

							<p>
								Finally, the push-pull leg routine. 
								This is typically recommended for individuals who can afford to train around 6 days a week. 
								As there are more training days involved, spending more days in the gym is mandatory. 
								On the bright side, the number of exercises per day may be reduced slightly as you are spending more days in the gym. You may also conduct a 7 day week where it goes push pull leg rest push pull leg rest, and so on. 								
							</p>
							<h2>Common mistakes regarding splits</h2>
								<p>I have seen many individuals who believe push pull leg is superior to full body training. 
									Despite having only 3 training days, they will conduct a push-pull leg and stop for the remaining days of the week. 
									This is far from ideal as on good weeks you will hit each muscle group once a week (which I do not recommend); 
									if something comes up and you can’t commit to training, 
									you may have to skip the body part for the entire week and only train after 2 weeks. 
									There are also multiple advanced bodybuilders who use upper lower and full-body training to build muscle, 
									do not feel discouraged if you are doing splits other than push pull leg. 
								</p>
								<p>Hopping from 1 extreme all the way to the other can also be detrimental to your training. 
									Perhaps you have tried training each body part once a week and you heard higher frequency is better so you conduct a full-body training immediately 6 times a week. 
									This will not only take a toll on your body but also demotivate you from training as you notice inevitably you are going nowhere. If you started out with a bro split (training each body part once a week), 
									try switching to maybe training twice a week with upper lower or full-body training. If you want to increase your frequency to 3 times a week you may do so after training with 2x frequency for some time. 
									Take your time and do not rush it.</p>
								<p>Moreover, the frequency may also aid with the increase in quality sets. 
									Training all your body parts once a week may not be optimal as training them twice as you are giving your body 2 stimuli in a week is, strenuous if I might add. 
									If you place all the volume in 1 day, there will be tons of junk volume as 2 to 3 exercises per body part may be sufficient to stimulate growth maximally. However, increasing it to 5 6 times a week may not be optimal due to compromised recovery, 
									especially if you are not advanced. 
									Slowly working your way up is the best way to progress. It is not necessary to increase the frequency if you are progressing well by training 2 to 3 times a week per body part. 
									Do not fix what ain’t broke.</p>
								<p>The table below shows the recommended split for individuals who want to train approximately 2-3 times a week based on available training days
