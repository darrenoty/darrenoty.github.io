							<h1>Sleep</h1>
							<p>Sleep is crucial and probably underrated among those who are interested in muscle growth
								and health (since you’re reading this, I assume you are one of them). 
								Ignoring sleep can be especially detrimental to your health in the long run 
								and hinder your muscle-building process. 
								Research has also shown that participants with reduced sleep 
								lost more muscle instead of fat with the same prescribed deficit. 
								Although the participants are not doing regular weight training sessions, 
								the connection is clear, sleep does have an impact on muscle
								retention, and what an impact it is. 
								
							</p>
						<p>The general recommendation for sleep will be approximately 7 to 9 hours per day. However,
							it varies among individuals as some may need a longer sleep time after an intense
							day and some genetic outliers can get sufficient sleep with just 5-6 hours
							(these individuals are rare, you are most likely not one of them, so read on). 
							They can feel completely rested with just a short duration of sleep compared to 
							the majority of the population. 
							So what if you only managed to get 4 hours of sleep that night? What happens then? 
							Obviously your training has been wasted, might as well stop training the next day 
							and go home to get some sleep, yes? If you said yes, please read on, I beg you; 
							if you said no, here’s your reward, the rest of this post. I understand that sometimes 
							sleep disturbances may occur and you may not get the required sleep to feel recharged, 
							but trying your best is the best advice that I can give you. 6 hours is better than 5 hours, 
							by that logic, 5 hours is also better than 4. Do not neglect sleep just because you 
							assume your sleep will be hindered, some sleep
							is still better than no sleep at all, the sunk cost fallacy comes to mind. 
							Taking naps can also be helpful for those who suffer from disturbances during their sleep. 
							If sleeping once is not enough, 2 will be better than 1 right?
							 However, taking naps too close to your bedtime may be counterproductive as 
							 it may hinder your sleep for the coming night. Sweetening the deal is the fact 
							 that sleep can also be important for fat loss as shown in research as well . 
							 In short, a lack of sleep will lead to an increase in ghrelin (hunger hormone) 
							 and a decrease in leptin (satiety hormone). This will make dieting much more difficult 
							 as you may end up overconsuming calories and gaining weight instead. 
							 Basically, if you don’t sleep, you get hungry and angry, 
							 then you eat more and end up gaining weight.

						<h2>DO NOT IGNORE SLEEP</h2>
						<h4>Tips to improve sleep quality</h4>
						<ol>
							<p> Avoid caffeine 6 hours before bed
							</p>
							<p>Sleep in total darkness
							</p>
							<p>Sleep and wake up at the same time every day
							</p>
							<p>Avoid exercising late at night as some may experience disturbed sleep
							</p>
							<p>Try aromatherapy and music if it helps you to relax</p>
							<p> Try to avoid screen time 2 hours before bed or use a blue light filter if it's unavoidable</p>
							<p>  Use your bed only for sleep or sexy time, separate working room and bedroom
							</p>
							<p>Meditation</p>


						</ol>
						<p>Caffeine will be able to provide a great morning boost as you will feel more energetic. However, if consumed later in the day, it may be a hindrance to your sleep. I understand
							that you may feel difficulty in conducting tasks later on during the day without the
							help of some caffeine, but this could very well be an effect caused by poor sleep quality
							from the previous night, which then  leads to you consuming
							additional caffeine to keep yourself awake and thus hinders sleep again that night. A perpetual toxic cycle if there ever was one. I would recommend you try having a good night's sleep and see if it helps, instead of repeating the cycle over and over again. 6 hours is just a recommendation as caffeine tolerance is highly individualized. Caffeine may not affect some people at all while some will experience disturbed sleep despite consuming caffeine 8-10
							hours prior to sleep. If you are using pre-workout which contains caffeine, you
							may want to exercise earlier in the day or reduce the serving to prevent disturbances to your sleep.
							</p>
							<p>Sleeping and waking up at the same time every day helps because your circadian rhythm (24-hour biological clock) will be regular which helps you to fall asleep easier at night. Therefore, it is best to sleep at the same time during the weekends and not have Netflix marathons (it's tempting I know, but your gains will thank you later).
