							<h1>My top 8 tips to lose weight</h1>
							<p>Weight loss is caused by being in a calorie deficit. In simpler terms, it means you use more energy than you actually consume. 
								The concept of weight loss is simple, however, many still struggle to lose weight. 
								Achieving a calorie deficit is easier said than done as many of us will try extreme diet strategies to achieve a deficit, but ultimately lose the willpower and end up gaining all the weight back, or even more. 
								With that said, I would like to share the strategies and ideas that assisted me in achieving weight loss.</p>
						<h2>1. Focus on what you can add, not remove</h2>
						<p>Instead of trying to remove foods like carbohydrate-rich foods eg. white bread, focus on foods to be included in your diet. 
							By eliminating foods that you love, you are restricting your choice of foods which may build up your cravings and end up with you binging in a state of weakness. 
							Emphasizing on fruits and vegetables will be a good start.
						</p>
						<h4>Types of foods to be added</h3>
						<ol><p><b>Fruits and vegetables</b>- They are a good source of fiber which will keep you full and satisfied, which in turn reduces hunger and any chances of overeating during a diet.
						</p>
						<p><b>Protein</b>- Ever wondered why bodybuilders eat huge amounts of protein? To build muscle, true,  but it also helps with satiety compared to other macronutrients such as carbohydrates and fats. 
							Protein also has the highest thermic effect of food where you spend more calories digesting protein compared to carbohydrates and fats.</p>
							<p><b>Low-calorie snacks</b>- Low-calorie snacks such as popcorn will be a good alternative to replace your potato chips as they are high in fiber and are able to prevent you from binging other high-calorie densed foods.
							</p></ol>
							<p>Adding more vegetables to every meal will decrease your calorie intake for the meals as the added volume will decrease the ability for you to consume other high-calorie-dense foods.
							</p>
							<h2>2. Increase physical activity</h2>
							<p>If you noticed I wrote about physical activity, instead of just exercising in general.
								 Any form of physical activity will be able to aid with weight loss, regardless of the type of activity. 
								 This includes using the stairs instead of the elevator and taking regular walks. 
								 However, regular exercise is also highly recommended as it will make you a healthier person in general. You may choose a form of exercise that you enjoy and conduct it regularly. Any form of activity is better than no activity at all.
							</p>
							<h2>3. Have sufficient sleep</h2>
							<p>Sleep is essential for everyone to function properly. 
								Insufficient sleep will lead to an imbalance between hormones such as ghrelin and leptin. 
								This will result in additional hunger throughout the day which leads to additional calories gained, adding obstacles to your weight loss journey. 
								Moreover, sleep will also result in higher weight loss from body fat instead of muscle. </p>
								<h2>4. Do Not skip meals or starve yourself</h2>
								<p>Skipping meals and starving yourself intentionally to lose weight is 1 of the biggest mistakes you can make while losing weight. 
									Why is that? Willpower only gets you so far. If you give in and start eating, you will end up binging and the calories you consumed will surpass the calories you skipped while starving, then you regret your actions and starve again, creating a vicious cycle. 
									Instead, eating enough low-calorie dense foods to keep you constantly full and satisfied is the better alternative, which was also mentioned in point 1, focus on what you can add instead of being hellbent on removing foods.</p>
								<h2>5. Knowing you cannot sustain the diet for the rest of your life, DO NOT try it in the first place	</h2>
								<p>Adherence and sustainability to a diet is probably the most important component. If you do not stick to a diet, no matter how amazing it is, it will not be useful. I understand that many famous diets are going on such as keto, low-carb, intermittent fasting, and many more. It may be tempting to follow them. However, are they suitable diets for you? 
									Trying out diets that you know aren't sustainable will end up wasting your time and effort, it may also be demotivating after gaining all the weight back.</p>
								<h2>6. Drink more water</h2>
								<p>Drinking water will not only suppress your appetite but also increase the calories you burn. Water that you consume has to be heated to 37 degrees celsius which is your body temperature. 
									This process will consume calories. Even though it is not much, the appetite suppressant effect will also be to aid in weight loss.</p>
								<h2>7. Strength training</h2>
								<p>Building more muscle will be able to increase your metabolism because muscle is metabolically active, making it easier to lose weight. You do not need to spend a huge amount of time in the gym like a bodybuilder, approximately 2 strength training sessions a week will suffice. Due to newbie gains, you will be able to gain muscle very early on in your lifting career.
								</p>
								<h2>8. Do it slow and take your time</h2>
								<p>I know there are many transformations out there indicating that they lose weight in just a couple of weeks or months, making it tempting for you to attempt their diet. However, crash dieting will often result in muscle loss which will reduce your metabolic rate, making it harder to lose more weight in the future. In addition, people who lose weight very quickly also tend to gain the weight back more easily. What is the point of losing weight in the first place if you are going to gain it back eventually? 
									Embrace the journey and do not rush it. Remember, slow and steady wins the race.</p>
								<p><b>Bonus Tip:</b>There is no fixed way or method to achieve your goal, the best diets and lifestyle choices out there are the ones that work for you.
