							<h1>Consistency vs Perfection</h1>
							<p>Of the 2, which do you think is the better choice? 
								Pursuing perfection may be tempting, but it is undeniably exhausting. 
								Once a beginner lifter myself, I tried to find the perfect diet, the perfect workout routine and the perfect schedule to balance my life between studies and fitness. In an ideal world, we all hope to be able to be perfect consistently.
							</p>
						<h2>Does perfection exist?</h2>
						<p>I guess this depends on how you define perfection. 
							If perfection means finding what’s best for you, I believe this is achievable. 
							However, I once defined perfection as something that couldn’t be criticized by anybody anywhere at any time. 
							I tried looking for the perfect diet by reading multiple books and watching countless videos on diets and dieting, and have come to this epiphany. 
							No matter how perfect something is viewed from 1 angle, it can always be criticized from another angle. 
							If it is perfect for someone else, does it imply you will be able to gain the same results as that person? 
							Would it be perfect for you as it was for the other?
						</p>
						<p>For instance, the Rock has a very impressive physique, I used to believe that is because his training and diet were perfect which led to that physique. 
							With the benefit of hindsight, following his training and diet routine is simply not possible for most of us. 
							How am I expected to wake up at 3 am just to hit the gym and then concentrate in class later on throughout the day? 
							A more suitable analogy would be in terms of hours studied, a smart fellow who studies 3 hours and heads for the exam would find it difficult to compare himself with another fellow who studies 3 hours but doesn’t understand the coursework half the time. Some geniuses may obtain 100 while others may only get a bare minimum to pass. 
							Clear as day it shows that we cannot make any reasonable connection between a different person’s effort and results with our own, it just taxes the mind unnecessarily. </p>
							<p>Trying to be perfect all the time will just lead to exhaustion and burnout. 
								Instead, pursuing consistency is what I believe is the key to success. 
								The perfect exercise routine is almost impossible to discover, following it is even harder, which leads to most of us giving up. 
								Having multiple okay-ish exercise sessions a week will be better than only having 1 exercise per week that you went out of your way to exhaust yourself. 
								Some form of physical activity consistently is better than having no physical activity at all. Do not give up just because you cannot commit to 1 full hour of exercise. As long as we keep doing something consistently and improve bit by bit, it is already worth it, it is already a step in the right direction.
							</p>
							<h2>Why is consistency the best?</h2>
							<p>Do you remember the exact date when your shoulders popped? 
								The exact date of your six-pack turned visible? The exact date where your girlfriend/wife first said she loved you?
								 You probably do not remember, as the date was never important in the first place. 
								 It was your consistent efforts in hitting the gym that improved your physique. Your consistent efforts of caring about your significant other led to her loving you. 
								You do not obtain results by just following a perfect workout routine once, but by consistently showing up.</p>
								<h2>Forget about trying to be perfect. </h2>
								<p>Being able to do something consistently and enjoying the process is what I believe to be the perfect method for all of us!
