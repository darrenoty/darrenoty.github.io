							<h1>My profile</h1>
							<p>Hi there, Iâ€™m Darren Ong, a dental student who enjoys 
								training in the gym and trying my best in balancing
								between my fitness journey and goal to become a dentist.
								I officially started going to the gym when I was in my 1st 
								year in India. The coaches there taught me the basics and 
								some exercises to perform every time I attended the session. I 
								immediately loved challenging myself with heavier weights 
								and rarely skipped a gym session since then. The gym was 
								like a place where I felt productive, a place where I could
								relieve my academic stress.</p>
							<p>Throughout my lifting journey, I went through ups and downs, made several mistakes, but at the 
								end of the day, I had fun, every single step of the way. There were times where the gyms were 
								closed and times where I struggle to balance between my personal life and staying committed to 
								fitness. I have learned to prioritize certain aspects and make compromises to get the best out of 
								my life. I was also once asked, if everything is predetermined according to your genetics (health, 
								disease, muscle gain potential), then why bother trying so hard to achieve something that may 
								not even be possible? I believe that we only know the answer to our genetic potential if we 
								actually do try. Since we only get 1 life/body, why not give our body the exercise it needs and try 
								out best until the end?</p>
							<p>I created this blog with the intention of sharing anything that I learnt, including my experiences and opinions. 
								Starting out may be difficult, which is why I hope you know that you are not alone in this journey. We may not be perfect, but we can always be the best version of ourselves.
							</p>
